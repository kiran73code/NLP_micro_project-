# SMSS SpamDetect Classifier Model

in this NLP micro project i constract the different models  based on two algorithm'
 >Simple Logestic Regression Algorithm

>Naive Bayes Algorithm


basically this particular dataset is collected from **UCI** website.
Machine_Learning_Repository you can get from this    [dataset Link](https://archive.ics.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection)

intiallt i do data cleaning and preprocessing and check the Acuuracy and **Type-I** and **Type-II** Errors in both models.
Both are give the same accuracy    _**98.47%**_
and they produce different Typa-I and Type-II Errors.
